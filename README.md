Hello Everyone,
I'm Mayura.
It is a simple talkbot which will give you the response to the questions that have been asked.
I have installed chatterbot of version 0.8.6, speech_recognition, pyttsx3.
I have created this in python version 3.6
The commands for windows to install these are
pip install chatterbot==0.8.6
pip install speech_recognition
pip install pyttsx3
pip install PyAudio

If you get any error regarding spacy, then
pip install spacy
If get error regarding pypiwin 32, then
pip istall pypiwin32

To avoid these errors, I recommend you to use python 3.6
If you have upgraded version, I recommend you to create python environment of version 3.6 and run all these
If you have conda, then to create a new environment
conda create -n env_name python=3.6
To activate environment
conda activate env_name

If you don't have conda installed, then
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv env_name python=3.6
